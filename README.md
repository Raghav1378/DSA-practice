# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms! This repository serves as a dedicated space to hone my problem-solving skills, explore various algorithmic techniques, and implement common data structures.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to:
* Strengthen my understanding of fundamental **data structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, etc.).
* Improve my proficiency in classic **algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, etc.).
* Develop efficient and optimized solutions for coding challenges.
* Track my progress and maintain a systematic record of problems solved.
